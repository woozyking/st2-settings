My Sublime Text 2 Settings

`These settings are currently Python friendly only`

Before or after syncing settings, follow instructions over [here](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) to install Package Control and it'll automagically pick up all the packages/plugins mentioned in settings and install them.

Have fun coding!
